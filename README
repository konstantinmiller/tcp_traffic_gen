1 COMPILATION

To compile on 32-bit machine, say

make trafficGen32

To compile on 64-bit machine, say

make trafficGen64

2 CREATING INTERFACE FOR MONITORING

To create a wireless monitoring device that will be used to collect radiotap headers, say

sudo iw dev wlan0 interface add mon0 type monitor
sudo ifconfig mon0 up

where wlan0 is the name of your wireless interface. You can find it out by saying

iwconfig

You need to create the monitoring device only once. After that it should work until rebooting.

3 RUNNING TRAFFIC GENERATOR

To run the traffic generator, say

sudo ./trafficGen32 --role=receiver --active --passive-ip=54.76.150.9 --passive-port=54341 --dev-name=wlan0 --dev-name-mon=mon0 --trace-duration=1800 --log-dir=/path/to/output/directory --tcp-info-log-interval=1000

Replace /path/to/output/directory by the path to the output directory.
Replace wlan0 by the name of your wireless interface.
Use trafficGen32 or trafficGen64 depending on your machine's architecture.
